LIPITOR.92,"Muscle aches and weakness in neck, arms, shoulders, upper back, legs. Severe pain in left foot and third and fourth toes. Pain and weakness increased until I needed help dressing and combing my hair. I could not do daily activities such as pick up a cup of coffee or put on a seatbelt without significant pain. The ball of my left foot was so painful I could not put pressure on it when walking so I walked on the side of my foot. Symptoms began 12 weeks after starting Lipitor. I reported to my cardiologist and internist who both denied problems were related to Lipitor because my CPK was only mildly elevated (250). I also saw a podiatrist, chiropractor, and spine specialist with no relief. When it got so bad I could not take it anymore and did not care about my cholesterol I took myself off of Lipitor and got a 50% improvement after one week. I then saw a neurologist who diagnosed me with statin induced myalgia. He said he sees a lot of patients with slightly elevated CPK that many physicians do not recognized as a symptom of a statin intolerance. I have been off of Lipitor for two years and continue to improve very slowly, but I still suffer from some pain and weakness. I can now walk normal, but my toes are still quite painful at times.

Knowing some cholesterol meds can cause leg pain my doc did some kind of check on me and said it was not the drug.

LIPITOR.51,"Had muscle pain in my back (primarily small of my back) and down my leg. I had tried Lipitor before and the result was achy legs. After some time off of this drug and feeling better, I tried it again. My back hurt so bad that I went to a chiropractor twice and no relief. I thought I might have a bulging disc but decided to go off the Lipitor again. After two months, I'm back to normal. I call this the drug from hell. ",CADEC

Over the past year, B/L shoulder pain to the point of wearing a sling because it hurt badly when I walked. I read about the shoulder pain in assorted sites on the web. Discussed it with my PA and cardiologist. My PA stopped the Lipitor. The pain lessened but did not stop. Went to a Ortho MD who gave me 3 Steroid shots and PT. It seemed to help but pain would not stop. Narcs were ordered which helped somewhat but wasn't the answer. MRI showed a slight linear tear in my Rotator Cuff which he wanted to do surgery. Decided against surgery. Both shoulders started to feel better but still couldn't sleep on my left side. My LDL's were through the roof. After almost 10 months off Lipitor, my general MD talked me into starting Sinivastatin 40 mg every day. Well, guess what happened. My shoulder pain suddenly worsen, especially left side. I am going to speak with my Cardiologist again and explore alternatives and will be stopping my Statin today! Moral of the story. Stay clear of Statin medications. ",CADEC

Have been on Lipitor for approx. 2 1/2 years. Within 5 months experienced alopecia, which I had never had before and excused as stress related. Nausea and vomiting began several months later, if taken within a 3-4 hours of eating. Then within a year of being on the medication, I experienced severe facial paralysis diagnosed as Bell's Palsey. Severe hip and back pain followed, along with depression, thoughts of suicide and paranoia. The overwhelming exhaustion that I felt every morning for over a year intensified. I have tried altering when I take Lipitor but it did not help with the nausea. I stopped taking the Lipitor 45 days ago after I began to experience hair loss again. I researched Lipitor in a pharmacy book and realized hair loss, along with most of my other ailments, were side effects. I started noticing improvement during the first 30 days. At 45 days, my facial paralysis is 99% gone, I wake rested, my back and hip pain are slowly improving and my overall mental wellbein. ",CADEC

This all became worst when my dose was increased from 40mg to 80 mg 3 months ago. I have now decided to try other methods to reduce my cholesterol. (Mine is hereditary).

Can't get to sleep and then can't get out of bed till late morning or midday. No strength. Loss of breath. So if a person goes off this, what is the drug alternative to keeping the cholesterol down?

LIPITOR.403,"I have been on this medication for approximately two years and it has been very affective in lowering my cholesterol; however, I did notice that I became depressed with intermittent muscle pain. I recently mentioned this to my physician and asked if he knew if this particular medication causes these symptoms as all my blood studies for liver function, etc have been normal. I decided to stop the Lipitor and within a few days I felt so much better. I will call him tomorrow and ask if I can be switched to another medication. It is a very effective medication, but obviously has its problems as indicated by those patients who had very similar effects. ",CADEC
LIPITOR.365,"this was the last shot at using a statin to reduce cholesterol ldl. I have tried all the statin drugs, you know the very expensive drug of choice for all the doc's out there. For all of you who now have extremely low LDL and a bad case of joint pain to the extent that it is very arthritic or having bad muscle cramps that you never got prior to the drug, it is from the statins. The drug is able to decrease LDL through a mechanism which also destroys and depletes your bodies ability to make CoQ10. This is necessary for they health of muscles and joints (that's why you are experiencing the joint pains and numbness). Remember your heart is a muscle, guess what is happening to it with the depletion of the CoQ10??? If you do some research on the internet, you will find that all these statins make no claims/nor have studies shown them to reduce heart attacks, but they cause muscle problems i.e. your heart, this is based on the fact that they put younger and younger people on these drugs and. I would recommend that you do your own research versus just listening to the doctor who wants your LDL down to like below 130, neurosurgeons, who have studied this would tell you not to get it all too low. And just because your test come back and show your liver functions are fine and don't show any broken down muscle toxins in the blood doesn't mean the lack of CoQ10 isn't breaking down and damaging your muscles very slowly. Mine always showed fine and I had severe arthritis symptoms in knees and hip joints (never had this in my life before statins) and bad muscle cramps (also never got those until statins). Granted is you have high blood pressure, high LDL, over weight and maybe smoke, then you probably need something to lower the LDL, if you only have high LDL, you don't. Read the drug company studies, they even say it may help prevent a heart attack when you have 3 of the aforementioned risk factors. ",CADEC

Most recently, been taking 80 mg. for two weeks. Enough already! I can't tell you how I regained my sanity when I found this on the web.

I have been taking it for about three months now. I will go for a blood test within a few days so we'll see how good it did its job. As far as side effects are concerned, I find that Lipitor also causes bloating and a great deal of gas build up although not as badly as my previous medication. I'm finding it difficult to fit into my clothes due to the bloating. I also find that it makes me a bit drowsy, almost like a sleeping pill. I therefore take it at bedtime but my sleep is not very sound and therefore not refreshing. I developed a pain that seems to originate at the base of my neck, travel down to my shoulder blades and then run to my shoulders, elbow and wrist. I first attributed this to work stress because I do a great deal of computer work. I thought perhaps that I was getting tendonitis looking at th. I have begun to take charge of fighting back against the side effects and have been taking multivitamins, B complex, CoQ10, and GasX for bloating. I can honestly say that today is the first day in months that I have felt really well. very little gas, almost no pain. I'll keep tabs on this and will report back on my ldh levels.

Less side effects from Lipitor than any other statin drug I've tried. Pravachol pushed cholesterol out my skin in boils.

After workouts I would be so tired to the point where I was going to bed at 8pm (I'm normally a night-owl). I was mostly feeling drained and tired which was unusual for me and didn't feel that way previous to taking the drug. I have also experienced tingling or a sense of my hand being asleep (example: if you lay on it wrong and it's numb-like). I have only been off one day. but have already slept better than I had in the 3 wks on it. Don't know if it worked to lower my cholesterol since I wasn't on it for the 6 wks to do the bloodwork. I am going to try to lower it naturally through exercise and diet instead of the drug. not sure it's worth the side effects. Stay in tune with your body.

Within two months, I had developed wicked back pain, along with neuropathy and hypersensitivity that wrapped around my abdomen. We suspected the Lipitor was involved, so I went off it, since my numbers had gotten really low. I was effectively laid up for about six months. Since there was no immediate improvement, we surmised that Lipitor wasn't causing this. It's October 2006 now, and I'm starting to feel more like myself, still hurts but I can work around it. The cholesterol has crept up, so two weeks ago we started the Lipitor again, and within a few days I was paractically flat on my back again! So, I've stopped again. It's a bloody shame this is happening, as the drug was extremely effective in dropping that cholesterol. Too bad, we're going to have to try something else, I guess. ",CADEC

I could hardly walk, sit or drive the car. The pain I was experiencing especially around the hipjoints was incredible. I told the specialist about these side-effects and he told me to reduce the dose from 1 a day to 1 every two days!? I had already stopped taking the lipitor for a week and the pain had decreased somewhat.

Though the cause of my pain remains undetermined, the Arthrotec combined with Paracetamol pretty much eliminated the pain. This was a big relief, as the 1200 MG of Ibuprofen I had taken throughout the night had done nothing. I only took 1 Arthrotec and 1 Paracetamol and that did the trick. HOWEVER: I had a very bad headache yesterday and Ibuprofen again didn't work. I still had the other Arthrotec pills left, so I took one. Although it alleviated the pain, I got up this morning with heavy vaginal bleeding even though my period ended last week. I was relieved to read that this could be a side effect, as it means I probably don't have something serious, but I will have to be in some serious pain to risk bleeding from the vagina again.

Not sure of how tight the correlation is between low chlosterol numbers and low risk of coronary problems. AMA dumbs down the information to make is sound like getting down to ridiculous levels (100) insures that you won't have problems. I doubt it. Probably much more based on genetic history.

Lipitor has robbed me and my family of my former active self and I have no idea whether I will ever return to normal. Will try the CoQ10 idea and also physical therapy to try to realign everything from my hips down so I can move normally again. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!

After 3 months, My trigycerides and total cholesteral went down, even though they were fine to begin with, but my CRP level went UP!!! From 5.96 to 13.2!! Since treating the CRP levels was the initial purpose in prescribing me Lipitor, and since it did NOTHING to help these levels, I am therefore unsure if taking LIPITOR for high C-reactive protein levels is necessary, let alone effective.

Lipitor does help reduce total serum cholesterol considerably in many patients but the side effects of this 'poisonous' medication are extremely alarming. I fail to comprehend why this medication is still permitted to be on the market as there is evidence that those who have been on long term have suffered irreversible muscle damage plus other permanent side effects. How come no one has sued the manufacturers as yet? Do patients have to die first before a pharmaceutical entity can be sued?

After being on Lipitor for 2 years my knees and elbows were getting increasingly stiff and sore. I'm a painter by trade and largely attributed it to over use of my joints. Repetitive stress syndrome. I went to my doctor, he sent me to an arthritis specialist, I had x-rays. nothing was found. I felt like an old (older) man during this period, I thought I was finished in terms of my trade and the things I enjoy most, like hiking. My prescription of lipitor ran out a few months after these tests were done. I didn't bother refilling it right away and noticed my knees and elbows felt better. I renewed the prescription and no sooner had I started taking it again that I felt the stiff joints return. So I stopped taking it, the stiffness goes away, started again, stiffness returns. After telling my doctor this story, right away he says oh yeah, that's probably right Pardon!? So why didn't you mention that possibility before all the tests? (luckily since I live in Canada, these tests were all covered by our health care system) I didn't make the connection to lipitor earlier because stiff, swollen joints were not listed as one of the side effects. Sore muscles yes, stiff swollen joints, no. I can see the class action suits coming against Pfizer. ",CADEC

Cholesterol went down drastically, doctors were thrilled, but I spent a year feeling exhausted and weak, unable to find words or remember names or follow the plot of a movie. All I thought about was where and when I could lie down. I was hardly able to lift things I could easily lift before. Legs would go wobbly after one flight of stairs. Everything was exhausting. Doing the shopping or vacuuming was like climbing Everest. Symptoms stopped within a week of stopping Lipitor. I can't believe I spent a year of my life like that. I will not recommend against Lipitor because some people do fine on it but I wish my Drs. had been more open to the idea that it was causing me problems. The only side effect they asked about was muscle pain, which I didn't have, and I was basically told Lipitor doesn't cause anything else. ",CADEC

The neurological damage I have suffered due to toxic levels of lipitor seems to be permanent. Nothing I have tried has reversed the extreme symptoms. in the beginning megadoses of coenzyme Q10 did help; that was 6 yrs ago. the deterioration continues. the slco1b1 mutation IS NOT rare, occurring in 26-34% of caucasian poulation, less in african am, and more in Asian pop. seems many individuals with the mutation(s) develop severe myalgias and myopathies, prompting discontinuance of the statin. for those of us who did not suffer the muscle dmaage, neurodegeneration is what occurs in my opinion.

DOC understood and has kept me off Statins. I wish those who take this stuff successfully the best, but for those of us who have adverse effects this can be deviating.

I stopped taking it for 4 days and the pain returned. Currently take one 75mg dose 2 hours before work and seems to be enough to ease my particular condition. Probably alright for otherwise healthy individuals but those with other medical problems should probably avoid it. It will most likely exacerbate there ill health with unwelcome side effects. ,CADEC

Luckily after being admited to the hospital I was seen by a rheumatologist who knew what she was seeing. I will never get back the full use of my arms or legs. ALL STATIN drugs are dangerous.

As i am only young and relatively healthy i did not experience any side effects. HOWEVER my parents both have had bad side effects. so i dont recommend it if you suffer from High blood pressure, IBS, are prone to stomache ulcers, prone to reflux, heart burn or are an asthmatic. Otherwise if like me you are healthy and just need pain relief when nothing else will cut it just take one a day, and dont stay on them. the chances of getting side effects seem to increase according to the length of time you continue using them (like most drugs) and the effectiveness of the pain relief can also wear off over time.

But then, very gradually, things began to change. Fatigue was the first symptom for me. It hit hard! I was retireing at 9PM when it used to be 11:30. Then the muscle and joint pain kicked in. I felt much older than I was. My family noticed the short term memory loss before I did. It was very embarrasing for me. The blisterey rash on my arms and legs had me concerned even more. What was wrong with me? Is this what old age(62) should normally bring? When my vision became blurry, I started my search. That was in June of 2007. By August 07, I was off Lipitor for good. My cardiologist tried various substitutes without luck until we got to Simivastatin which seemed to work without the side effects. ",CADEC

I was blaming my antibiotic for these side effects, but now I see that they come and go with the use of the solaraze. Scary. LEt me be the first to say that I have extremely porous skin, so I am probably absorbing a higher dose than was thought likely, I have eczema and take other meds that exfoliate my skin, so probably a whopping dose is going in. I have found that I can use a q-tip and just put it on a few spots and then do not get the global bad effect, so I may do it this way and just treat one arm at a time, then one leg. ",CADEC

At first, I thought that this might be gout, because it runs in my family, and my toes swell up occasionally. But, after my doctor confirmed that my swollen knees were not gout, I began to consider other causes. It dawned on me to check the internet concerning the Lipitor I have been taking. Sure enough, many people have the same troubles. I used to be able to walk for endless miles. For about the same amount of time I have been taking this drug, I have been hobbling around, cautious of every painful step.

And just yesterday, was out doing the yard spring clean-up, and noticed extreme fatigue and shortness of breath. Very worrisome. I have stopped taking Lipitor, and will check back with my doctor asap. I just recently had my 3 month cholesterol check-up, and the doctor was very pleased since my overall cholesterol count dropped to 3.7 from over 7.

The constipation is starting to go away as are the dry eyes although they are still quite painful.

She said she realized that my cholesteral would go back up, but CPK is of concern. Was raised to mid 200's. After a month I went in and of course my cholesteral was back up and my CPK level was elevated to over 500. Now am having another blood test a week later. Not sure what it will show but I feel horrible. Tingly hands, terrible musche aches. She told me no excercise until we determine what the problem is with CPK level.

Stopped taking it immediately (3 days ago) and already I can move my feet and ankles. Not hobbling around and can get out of bed without assistance. Hands still sore but have some movement back in my fingers. Hoping this will continue to improve given more time off the drug. This drug is poisionous. I haven't felt well since I started taking Lipitor. The fatigue was as bad as the pain in my joints, if not worse.

I immediately went back to pharmacy and got brand name again (luckily my insurance pays-it will be $15/ 3 month supply more, but it's worth it). I have noticed just within the last two days the tingling is gone. Thank goodness!

About two years ago I started waking up with significant congestion with clear phlem. Chest xray was clear. My doctor suspected allergies. Having 2 pets that seemed reasonable. About a year ago my elbows would burn like fire at times when I rested my arms on a surface. This would come and go. I also began having trouble focusing while reading and would skip around. Two months ago my right heel became painful for no reason. The more I walked on it the worse it felt. I switched shoes with no change. It hurt enough that I began to worry I might end up on disability if it got much worse. I was recently out of state for two weeks and still had congestion in spite of being in a totally different environment. That was when I suspected the Lipitor and did some research on line and saw matches with all of my symptoms. I immediately stopped it and the next morning the congestion was 80% less. I saw my doctor who agreed I need to stop it. He explained that there are a lot of side affects and there is no way to predict who will get which ones or when they will develop.

After nearly committing suicide due to statin-induced depression, I stopped all statin meds. My depression lifted quickly, panic attacks stopped, my hair started growing back.

Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection (one of the side-effects) and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any more stomach pain or urgency. I also had been experiencing lack of energy for quite some time and I attributed this to stress but after reading this website I feel it was due to the Lipitor also. I don't think I will take this drug anymore and since I read that taking vitamin C can help you with your cholesterol I think I will try this method instead. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.

In four months, my cholesterol dropped 100 points, HDL and LDL were in better, though not perfect balance. With my cholesterol at 139, I declined to take more Lipitor. Got HDL and LDL into perfect balance within another two months using certain over-the-counter amino acids, tocotrienols, and other nutrients I found online that supposedly do the job. They do! And the nice thing is, if my cholesterol goes up again, I know that very low dose of Lipitor will take care of it. Good stuff!. ",CADEC

I read this website and feel that lipitor is causing my pain. I have been to numberous orthopods, rheumetoligists, neouroligist, and others who cannot find any problems.

Along with the increased dosage, came crippling pain in my back, neck and then just my left foot, severe pain in my neck to the point where I couldn't hold it up without an effort, increased sinus pain, high blood pressure, insomina, blurred thinking. So to fix all these problems, I was given lots of other meds and tons of physical therapy and exercise each day. All so I could have great numbers. Finally, I realized enough was enough, I called the nurse practitioner to say I was stopping Lipitor and she was not really happy to put it mildly.

The effect was dramatic. The cramps did not occur during the night after I did not take the 40 mg with my dinner. They also did not occur on the following two nights. I did not want to restart the Lipitor (once a day with the evening meal) for fear that the cramps would just as quickly return. Since it was possible that the reason why the night cramps ceased so quickly is that I was taking the 40 mg entirely in the evening, I decided to split the pills and take half in the morning and half in the evening.

I kept asking my doctor if there were any side effects like mine and he said no. I had been taking zocor with no problem but insurance company wouldn't pay for it anymore and made me go on lipitor. After about six months I had my docteor write a letter to ins. co. saying I couldn't take lipitor and they agreed to put me back on zocor. But the long term effect of those six months sent me into a psyhcological tailspin that I never recovered from. I went to three psychiatrist and they finally came up with a diagnoses of bipolar disorder. Cause unknown. This was three years ago. The drug ruined my life, I am now seperated after this all occurred and before the lipitor I was an energtic happy family man with a great wife and two kids. I know it was the lipitor because the only other medication I take is an aspirin once a day. ",CADEC

I too had Bell's, I went back and looked at my cholesterol chart and found I got Bell's before I started on lipitor. There seems to be a consistent occurence of muscle pain and/or liver problems but I wonder how many other problems are not really attributable to lipitor eg see my Bell's palsy. Also I get night muscle cramps but I have had occasional muscle cramps at night since I was a child, Maybe my memory isn't as good as it was but I'm 70 and I still passed one of the hardest bar exams in the country less than 2 years ago.

LIPITOR.176,After about 4 years of taking Lipitor I started experiencing severe leg cramping at night with the pain traveling to my buddocks and stomach as well. The pain was so bad I could not get out of the bed and had to crawl to get to the bathroom to take Advil for the pain. I asked my doctor what could have caused this and he said it was probably from the Lipitor. Recently I experienced extreme stomach pain that stretched to my side and back. The stomach pain came suddenly and it would come and go for a week before it became so bad I could not sleep. I had just gotten over a urinery tract infection and I thought it had returned but the symptoms were different. I still had the urge to urinate constantly but it would come and go and I would have no symptoms for a day then it would return again. I remembered reading the phamplet that comes with the prescription drugs and it mentioning some of symptoms that I was experiencing. I stopped taking the Lipitor for a day and I did not have any mor. I think there should be a better alternative to lowering cholesterol than such a potent drug that can cause so many side effects.

Decreased energy and constant lethargy. . Although it lowers wy cholesterol levels appropriately, it seems to have given me debilitating side effects that have decreased my enjoyment of life in general.

I eat salad everyday for lunch, eat fruit and vegetables daily, and take many vitamins and supplements ( astaxanthan, MSM, alpha lipoid acid, vit. B complex, 500mg of time release Niacin, and more). One would expect me to be healthy and have a ton of energy, but instead, I feel Ike I have one foot in the grave and the other on a banana peel. I attribute all the negatives to the Lipitor.

While it did lower my Cholesterol numbers (as did Simvastatin afterwards), I'm not sure it was worth it.

I started using the drug in Sept. 2005. In October/November I noticed my hands were nowhere near as strong as they once were - thought it was old age. I also had a strange senistivity in the palms and soles of my feet, also in my scalp - it was uncomfortable blowing my hair dry. It was not a tingling, just a sensitivity. In November, I was running, and my feet felt like led - thought it was old age. In December, my ankles started aching - gee, am I getting old! In January, I started to go to the gym, and I think that this is where my problems really started. My already over-streesed muscles, over a short period of time, went into meltdown.

However, at that time - over a month ago - I was only aware of Norvasc's side effects and, indeed, when I stopped taking it most of the anxiety and paranoia symptoms disappeared - most, but not all. That is when I started looking for the other culprit. Sure discovered it soon: Lipitor. Spoke to a psychiatrist and she confirmed that the entire family of Norvasc (called amlodiphine) is known to have psychiatric side effects. A month ago my family physician confirmed that Lipitor is guilty of similar symptoms and agreed to let me off it for three months, until I take my next blood test.

LIPITOR.112,"Anxiety, paranoia. I went to see my doctor and told him about my discovery. First he was a bit reluctant but in the following meeting he already told me that he had read about Lipitor's psychiatric side effects. He therefore put me off Lipitor completely and suggested a much lower dosage of 10mg Crestor. In addition, he prescribed a new medication: Niacin, beginning with 500mg the first month and then increasing to 1,000 in the second (with the ultimate aim of reaching 2,000 in the fourth monthly). Bottom line: When I discontinued Lipitor two months ago my LDL reached 165. This week my blood test indicated an LDL level of 124. So, after being helped by folks on this website I hope I can be of some help to others who suffer from statin side effects. Therefore, here is what I've done during the past two months: - Took 500mg of Niacin during the first months and 1,000mg during the second; - Took a total of 10 Crestor pills (10mg which are equivalent to 20mg of Lipitor) per month, i.e., one every three days. - Two natural pills of Phytosterol. - A cup of tea made of olive leafs. Now, I do believe that when I reach the maximum intake of Niacin in two months (2,000mg) the LDL will drop from 124 to 100 (the level required for diabetics). Good luck, folks!. ",CADEC

It has lowered it and kept it down but I was told by the doctor just yesterday to stop the Lipitor because of the syptoms I am having. I am hoping that these syptoms will go away since I can barely walk without pain and fatique. I have also experienced gastro problem. I would like to hear from anyone who may be off the drug and feeling better??. ,CADEC
LIPITOR.37,"I was on Pravachol for about 10 years without any significant reduction in my total cholesterol. Was switched to Lipitor 40mg initially with fair results and then to 80mg with excellent results. My present total cholesterol is 160, HDL, LDL and ratios are all acceptable. Have noticed no side effects. My only complaint with the drug is the cost and the fact that Pzier has not allowed the generic to be manufactured in the USA until 2012 and yet it is available this year in the UK as a generic.

LIPITOR.465,"I started taking Lipitor after my cholesterol climbed to 310. I Did not want to take it because I am a vegetarian, a health conscious person and dislike taking medicines, but my doctor, an endocrynologist, strongly recommended it. The first few months I was not aware of any side effects, but about a month ago I started to experience wrist pain, I thought it was my pilates class, but although I rested for 2 months from the class, the pain continued. Then about two weeks ago, I got very bad cramps in my toes, they curled down and the pain was terrible. About a week ago I was taking a bath and my muscles in my lower abdomen started to contract then the cramp got higher. I got scared that I was having something bad. After the cramps one night I had such tiredness in my left leg that I could hardly walk, I thought that it was my high heels that I had worn all day. Then 2 days ago I woke up with a swollen foot, it was very painful to walk. That was it. I suspected that it was the Lipitor and came to the internet and read the same side effects in a lot of people posting their experiences with this drug. I even thought that I had ALS since a friend of mine died of it. It is amazing the amount of people that also thought the same in this list. Thanks God for the Internet. I stopped taking this medicine 2 days ago, I hope that I can get rid of these effects and that they are not permanent.

After 1 more month had episodes of extreme fatigue, increased belching, stomach discomfort and leg heaviness, low bp and pulse. Like the flu without fever. Hospitalized and cathed again but heart arteries were fine and previously placed stents open Dr stopped blood pressure meds and Lipitor. He was back to normal in a week.

I've tried at least 5 other meds for this condition but this one is most effective. The lowest the other ones took it was to 300. My endocrinologist thought this was going to be the best it could be controlled. So, I really believe in this drug, but must consider what it may be doing to my body and my degree of pain.

I was on 10 mg and complained about discomfort in my legs but my cardiologist just said it was old age and even upped my dose to 20 mg. That really made things a lot worst and now I just stopped it and within 24 hours could see an improvement. Incidently I am a physician and was aware of the myalgia with Lipitor but I suspect it is much worst than the drug company would have you believe. This is really a very toxic drug and should be used with caution. This is a drug which is very effective in lowering cholesterol but also affects many metabolic pathways in the body and is potentially dangerous. ,CADEC

I could not sleep for the ache and discomfort in my legs. I was sure I was a few months away from a wheelchair. I was horribly depressed. When I asked my doctor about this pain, he took me off Lipitor, and within one week my pain had stopped completely. I can walk fine, I can even run. I sleep like a baby.

Well, let me tell you after taking this increased dosage for about two months I've had such gas pains around my abdomen and my back and also leg cramps. I finally went to see a Dr in Urgent Care as the pain was so severe. He examined me and could not find any swellings etc and asked me if I had done anything different with my meds.

I have Sores on the inner cheeks. Weird tight feeling in chest cavity at times, when exercising. I was in otherwise good health before starting, although it's only been a week. It should be noted that this is my third time trying this med. I am not drinking the koolaid on this miracle drug. I think it has major side effects that the mfgs are still not attributing to the drug. There is a lot of good reads out there, including articles in the NY times - do some research - it seems a lot of us are on the fence. I'm in a very high risk category, with levels over 300, a horrible ratio, and tryc through the roof. ",CADEC

LIPITOR.13,"While taking 10 mg I have experienced no adverse side effects. It was only when increased to 20mg/day that I experienced increased bone and muscle pain. I have been taking Lipitor 10mg per day since 1997 with no adverse effects. The only problem I experienced was when one Dr increased my dose to 20mg per day to lower LDL to prevent another infarction. I have never had real high cholesterol, 218 at tops and now am around 158 total, triglycerides are also excellent. I have found that when using substitutes for this drug, I experience adverse effects, so I only take the name brand now. Good drug if you are started with a low dose right off the bat. Many Docs want to start you at 20mg or above, too much for the body to take, I think. ",CADEC

It felt like I was having a baby and broke out in a cold sweat, shaking uncontrollably, nauseated, several bowel movements. I felt like I was going to pass out, which would have been welcommed after feeling what I felt. The pain subsided fortunately within 15 minutes, but now this morning I have vaginal bleeding and I am only 11 days into my cycle.

LIPITOR.284,"Took 10mg lipitor for approximately one year. Experienced lethargy, tingling in arms, trouble sleeping, irritability, anxiety, mild depression. Finally went off all statins when I experienced a particularly bad reaction when the doctor, with a gleam in his eye, recommended combining lipitor with Zetia. The results were so bad in terms of side-effects that I ceased all statins and discontinued the Zetia in short order. I now take no statins, no Zetia. Individually they have their own problems; combined they are extremely dangerous and, in my opinion, should be banned as a combination therapy. Probably safe in short doses, a very bad candidate for long-term use unless closely monitored and used in lowest possible safe doseage. Would warn other patients to NOT COMBINE LIPITOR OR OTHER STATIN WITH Zetia, a common tactic that you will most likely regret. Let the pharmaceutical reps take the meds they peddle and get them off the street, instead of handing out free clocks, watches, and vacations to cowboy-style doctors who are little less than drug-pushers.

Over this time, I gradually began to feel like an old, old lady and I was taking medication for arthritis and being tested for sorgren's syndrome. I was also joking about developing alzheimers but was really terrified of my memory problems and slurred speech! My internest never suggested it could be the lipitor.

All symptoms worse upon waking. I significanlty lowered my chol by using 10mg lipitor and excercising. However, for months I attributed all my pains to my busy schedule and my exercise routine. I went from a 36 year-old who can do 60 min of cardio/45 min of free weights every other day, to someone who can barely pick up his 15 mo. son. My life right now is a disaster. I've been off it 2 weeks and the pain has only subsided 20%. I can barely walk when I wake in the morning. I cannot get anything done around the house. My life right now is depressing until I get back to normal. All exercise has ceased and my wife picks up the slack for chores around the house that I cannot do. I HAVE NEVER experienced symptoms like these in my life. I am hoping this goes away soon and doesn't cause any long term damage. I cannot say that I'd do it over again.

I began getting very severe muscle pain in my left shoulder, arm and chest area. I was told by the doctor that I probably pulled a muscle. After 6 weeks of taking lipitor and constant pain and twitching I took myself off of the medication.

I usually avoid confrontations. The aggitation is one of my biggest concerns. Also growing more and more tired. I cut the dose from 10mg to 5mg and reduced above side effects by about 40%. Surprised when I found others had similar symptoms. Took 10mg of Lipitor for 6 weeks and dropped my cholesterol from 310 down to 225. Mentioned how I felt and was directed to cut the dose in half.

Heavy bleeding started within 30 minutes after the cramping ceased. Medical personnel dismissed the symptoms as not being related to taking this drug, but once I stopped taking, my cramping and bleeding stopped. Subsequent uterine & vaginal ultrasounds did not show anything else to be the cause. My OB/Gyn told me that she uses misoprostal (1 of the drugs in Arthrotec) for miscarriages & advised me to stop taking the drug. I would not recommend to females.

I've recently had this severe hip pain on both sides which the co codamol wasn't touching so I went back to the Dr He recommended this anti-inflamatory and as he said next stop would be cortozone injections I was willing to give it a try. I've tried it for a week but it makes me feel dreadful. Every time I stand up I have to hold onto something for fear of falling over, I feel sick and light headed and I get those waves of nausea where you suddenly feel all clammy. It's very much like having a permanent hangover, even down to the hunger which until I read thsi site I hadn't connected to the rest of it.

I was searching for answers on why I am in such pain throughout my body, mental confusion at times and also short term memory loss which all seemed to be growing steadily worse for the past few years. I blamed it on stress (with a dying husband), arthritis, advancing age etc and even discussed leg pain and body cramps with my doctor which he attributed chiefly to age and arthritis. I even had tests done on arteries to see if that could be the cause as I have an aortic aneurysem and thought perhaps my problems could be from poor circulation or blockage somewhere. They all checked out okay. It has been unbearable for several weeks now off and on and I suffered fatigue, lack of energy and growing depression and a feeling a fragility where I had always been a strong woman until recent years. I looked up fibromyalgia thinking I might have that but when I casually looked up lipitor the ratings leaped out at me. These people all were experiencing my symptoms!!! THANK YOU for providing this web site it may very well have saved my life. I am contacting my doctor immediately and as of now no more lipitor. It did lower my cholestral but greatly lowered my quality of life and I guess I am going to do exercise and have joined weight watchers and see if I can control it in that manner.

I stopped Lipitor as an experiment, and after 3 days the pain changed completely. It began to heal after that. Every week since has been a marked improvement. After 7 weeks, it's nearly healed. I can again hike for miles without the horrible pain I experienced for over 6 months while taking this drug.

When I incresed lipitor from 5 mg to 10 mg about 3 months ago, I started to experience the following side-effects started at different time: loss body balance, joint pain, muscle aches, weak legs, and some memory loss. About 2 months ago while I first told my doctor I lost some body balance and it might be due to lipitor buy my doctor told me the side effect was most likely by some other reason(s). During my second visiting him, he told me my blood test CK is 90 and my muscle should be OK. Then I continued to take 10 mg lipitor, but I felt more on muscle and joint pain and I started to feel I lost some memory. Therefore, I deeply believed that I had side effects by taking lipitor. After about a week to 10 day without lipitor, I got my memory back to nomal level and my body balance is getting better. During my third doctor visit, my doctor finally believed that I got bad side effects and he told me it would take months for recovery. Now my doctor wants me to take B3 or Niaspan instead of lipitor.

After two weeks of not taking Lipitor my arm almost recovered and I can work without any pain or any problem. It started a long time ago with tingling in my arms, they were often fall asleep, usually when I wake up in the morning. From month to month pain was worst until I almost lost all strength and couldn't use my arm. Anyway, I think I made a good decision by not using Lipitor anymore (my doctor will be mad at me).

There have been reports of worsening of gum disease as well, which I had had and which did improve.

I saw another doctor and this physician is the one that stated that Lipitor is more than likely the cause. Another family member was on Lipitor and experienced very similar symptoms. She took herself off of the medication her symptoms also began to fade. She demanded to be put on another medication and was.

I started taking extra Relefen and Prednisone which helped only temporarly. I could hardly lift a glass of milk without using both hands, I was so weak in my arms and hands. One day it just hit me.

Oddest feeling that I've ever experienced - very scary. Lasted approximately 45 seconds, followed by feeling of weakness and impending doom. By the time I arrived at the hospital I was shaking with chills uncontrollably. After tests were run I was told that it wasn't a heart attack or shroke. They said it was probably related to stress or a panic attack -- ridiculous because I haven't been stressed and have never had any problem similar.

I am only 53 yrs old! I have low blood pressure, I do not have coronary artery disease, I am not a diabetic.

Problem solved! Was on the meds for 7 days when I experienced chest discomfort and upper abdominal pressure. With a medical background, I know that cardiac symptoms are mistaken for gastric reasons so I went to the ER. Long story short, I was diagnosed with severe gastric distress (GERD) and with a ""gastric cocktail"" and a high octane prilosec, I had some serious relief and sent home. Not convinced it was the issue, I went a day without the RX and then started again. I wasn't entirely 100% after taking the dose and now, I am fairly certain it was the Voltaren.

She is annoyed that I will not take any. I am taking Red Yeast Rice with COQ10 now instead of a statin along with 2000 mg of Vitamin C daily. Basically Lipitor has ruined my formerly active life.

My doctor had seemed so completely unwilling to accept that my symptoms could've possibly been related to my taking Lipitor. However, I know my body and know when things are not as they should be. I have been feeling this way since almost immediately after I took my first dose. Hearing that so many other people have experienced the same exact symptoms as me has given me the courage needed to STOP this medication. So many of my family members and friends have had bad reactions to this stuff- I can not trust it, and will be looking for another way to get my cholesterol under control, if possible. Be very careful and very informed before you start any new medication. Don't always trust the word of your doctor as the only word and take it at its face value. When it comes to your body, you have every right to dictate, understand, and call the shots about what does and does not go in to it. ",CADEC

I didn't notice any problems for just over 2 months then all of a sudden one day I stared feeling horrible like a severe flu just hit me. For the next few days I couldn't get enough sleep I was incredibly week and had pains throughout my upper body. I saw my regular Dr and decided to stop taking the drug, she also drew blood. Luckily most of the tests came back normal but there was a small spike in something with my liver which was normal before. My Cholesterol was LDL 95 HDL 109 (which I thought it is advertised to raise?) and my triglycerides were great as well.

In my 11th year I have now developed Tinnitus (ringing in the ears) as well as still all the above side effects.

LIPITOR.646,"Was on Lipitor 10 mg per day for about 5 years and experienced chronic and acute back pain which gradually improved but seemed strange to me because I hadn't really done anything to strain my back muscles. New doc gave me a different statin but I had leg cramps so he put me on Baycol. Baycol was removed from market so next doc put me back on Lipitor. My cholesterol level increased to slightly over 200 so my doc increased dosage to 40 mg a day. Hand and leg cramps returned. Hands diagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome and I wore a hand brace to sleep several nights a week which controlled the symptoms. Recently developed inflammation of my foot muscles and joints and (apparently) plantar fasciitis of my left foot. Doc prescribed 800 mg Motrin qid but the foot problems became worse. General weakness in my feet, calves, and hands and tingling and burning in the soles of my feet. Depression, for which I've been taking an SSRI for about two years and may not be related to the Lipitor. I had high cholesterol (over 350) and was prescribed Lipitor in 1996 after other methods failed to have much effect. I have taken two stress tests over the past ten years and was told I had a healthy cardiovascular system with no trace of heart disease. I am 6' tall, weighed 177 lbs., and considered myself healthy until recently. I need to be able to pass a physical readiness test, including a 1.5 mile run, every 6 months because I'm in the military. I took myself off Lipitor because I can not take the physical readiness test. In fact I need a cane in the morning to get out of bed. I am not overweight. I was told to stretch and exercise more but that has not helped my symptoms, which have continued to worsen. Until recently I walked to work and shopping, 4 or 5 miles most weekdays, and more on the weekends. I also ran 2 miles, 3 times a week. Now I have difficulty walking and problems with my balance and I've gained 10 pounds because I've become sedentary. Two days after taking myself off Lipitor my feet have improved a little and I'm looking forward to resuming a more active lifestyle. I think my symptoms are a result of Lipitor. ",CADEC

The week I started to take I had the chest ache, confirmed to be muscular by doctors. At the start of the second week, I accidentally took a dose in the morning instead of the night because I took the wrong pill (skipped the night dose). The day after I started to have the other symptons. The worst one - the mouth one has faded, but the others remain. I found out too late grapefruit juice can make this drug stronger. I drank it some days during the first 2 weeks. Stopped drinking it. At the beginning of third week I took 50mg of CoQ10 per day for 3 days. I couldn't sense an improvement, but after stopping for other three days I will try again. (I need better evidence before buying a can of CoQ10, it is very expensive and hard to find around here). Will beg my cardiologist to let me try natural exercise before continuing statins. Giving it a 3, because it was effective , in a single month and with ezetimibe and exercise all my numbers are in very safe ranges. Please be careful about natural supplements. Homeopathy simply does not work - it is just water - The supplements that do work may also have side effects, just like the drugs.

The pain lessened by following all these recommendations but I was still uncomfortable a lot of the time. I finally went to see the orthopedist in March and he said my foot ""can"" improve if I continued with the exercises, etc At the very end, he asked if he had given me the ""patch"" at my first appointment; so I left with a sample and a prescription for the Flector patch. I cut a patch (there are five in each reclosable pouch) in half and it covers the heel area. After I used it the first time, the puffiness and pain were gone! I found it best to use the patch at night only although you can replace it every 12 hours. I put the patch on at bedtime, tape the edges down and wear a sock to secure it. Initially, I used it every night and after about three weeks, was able to cut down to several times a week. It certainly helped to make the past month more comfortable. ",CADEC

Cholesterol has very little to do with heart disease, and ALL statins are toxic. See www.spacedoc.net A site by a former family physician/NASA flight surgeon, disabled by his use of Lipitor.

Do the benefits outweigh the severe side effects-Pfizer says it's rare but serious side effects-I know many people that have had the same problem with muscle damage so I would not consider the side effect to be rare and now since I'm off the drug wonder how much permanent damage to my muscles is their due to this awful drug. ,CADEC

I stopped taking Lipitor for about a week and felt somewhat better, Christmas over by then, once again I considered stress as the cause and not Lipitor. I went back on Lipitor about a week ago and feel horrible again. Found this website and no longer doubt the source of pain, etc is definitely from taking Lipitor.

It became progressively worse, and by the end of the first month had created a massive triangular rash on my forehead, as well as a patch on one cheek. The skin was very red and rough, and made public life miserable and embarassing. I stopped taking Lipitor and the rash cleared up greatly, but has NEVER gone away completly, flaring up slightly from time to time, but not nearly as bad as it was during dosing with Lipitor. I was not taking any other medications at the time, and never had eczema before. The anti-lipid effect of Lipitor was unusually strong in my case, causing my CHO to drop below 90 (from a baseline of over 200). by the end of the first 2 weeks of dosing, my physician had me cutting the smallest dose tablet in half to be taken once a day.

I even purchased a sleep number bed & a new sofa, thinking that would help my insomnia & back pain. All to no avail. My symptoms slowly crept up during my 15 years of statin use.

LIPITOR.972,"I am the advocate for my father who took this drug for 8 months before he passed from an aggressive form of brain cancer in 2005. The patient data is reported for him by me. Briefly, my research during my advocacy efforts during his illness indicated that this drug may have contributed to the onset of his particular form of brain cancer (glial cell related cancer). That cancer was diagnosed 6 months after his initial Rx for Lipitor -- he died 2 months after his initial cancer diagnosis. There were no warning signs, deterioration was very fast and debilitating -- he was a model totally healthy individual by conventional medical standards. My father was vibrant and could work any teen into the ground for a 75 year old, had great cholesterol numbers, but he was a cardiac patient. He and the cardiologist agreed to go to Lipitor to see if they could drive LDL below 100 (his lipid profile was very, very good by usual medical standards). I will say that there was no way any doctor could have known this would happen (my research showed that Lipitor could contribute to this cancer with prior risk factors for it which would have to have been environmental exposure and from what I know of my father's work history experience), but it would help if conventional medicine would listen to patients and their families about experiences that we all are reporting in places such as this. My father could not speak for himself as his form of brain cancer was so aggressive that he went from a totally normal guy walking with a cane from initial neurological damage at inital dx for brain cancer to bedridden, unable to speak, feed himself, do anything for himself in 10 days. Don't know if this will really help anybody -- but just please be cautious with Rx medicines and advocate for yourself; you may not know everthing, but you do know best about what you are experiencing with these Rxs. keep doing your research, tell your doctor anything you find relevent about your life as it relates to Rxs you are given, and advocate hard for your quality of life.

Since taking Lipitor my hair has started falling out at an alarming rate. The thinning is most pronounced at the back and sides of my head so it's not conventional male pattern baldness. Lipitor has certainly lowered by cholesterol but I've stopped taking it after 9 months. The stress caused by losing my hair in this way will probably do me more harm than having high cholesterol.

LIPITOR.780,"SEVERE FATIGUE IN MY BODY AND TIREDNESS AND MUSCLE PAINS IN MY HIPS THAT CONTINUE TO THIS DAY AFTER BEING OFF THE DRUG FOR ALMOST A YEAR. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!!!. I was put on this drug by my doctor for my somewhat high cholesterol. The next day, after starting this drug, I suddenly felt like I had aged to eighty years old overnight but did not connect it to starting Lipitor. Up until the start of this drug I felt that I was as young as I was in my twenties and wondered if this is how you might start feeling the affects of age, by waking up one morning and feeling all that age caught up with you and now you were older than your years. I took the drug for two terrible months and then had a blood test and my cholesterol had dropped. My doctor mailed me the results of my blood test but did not send me a new prescription like he had the last time so I did not know that he wanted me to get it refilled. So I went off of Lipitor and within two months I was feeling normal again and even took a job with the post office where I walked five miles a day with no problem. I did not associate my getting better with my coming off Lipitor, unfortunately. Then I had an appointment with my doctor and he said I should have refilled that prescription by calling his office. So I did and the next day, after taking only one pill, I was eighty years old again. This time I did associate it with the start of Lipitor and then read the warnings the drug store gives you with meds and found that my symptoms were the same as what they warned against. I am not a hypochondriac and I never read those warnings so this was not a head thing. I immediately went off the drug but a year later I am still have the same eighty years old feeling and do not know that I will ever be normal again. I do not understand how just one pill can do that and this time I am not recovering like I did the first time. This has ruined my life and I would never have taken Lipitor if I knew what I know now and I am so sorry that I ever heard of this drug. This is so severe that I think taking it for even a short time can cause permanent damage. My doctor, when I told him of all this, wanted to change statins because he was still worried about my cholesterol. I told him no more statins and he then prescribed Zetia, which he said was was less effective but was not a statin, which I am still afraid to take unless I improve from the affects of the Lipitor. He told me he was on Lipitor himself and that he had no problems but then said, well he did have neck pains that could have been a side affect, but that he had been on the drug two years before this developed. I told him of the information on this site that describes some people having that delayed reaction and I advised him to take himself off of this drug for a couple of weeks to see if the neck pains cleared up! I advise, DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG!!!!!. ",CADEC

I stopped taking it the next day and within 72 hours my swelling decreased significantly, muscle aches and joint pain disappeared, memory loss is not as severe, breathing is easier, stamina is back etc I mentioned these same things to my cousin who has since stopped taking it as well. She can't thank me enough for giving her life back! I haven't told my doctor yet, she doesn't like when I am informed. need to change doctors. ",CADEC

I had noticed 5 years prior to this that my muscles seemed to never feel the same as before I started on a statin drug. I kept thinking is this old age. It got so bad that I could hardly walk after sitting for any period of time. I finally called my doctor and was advised to stop the statin drug. It took a few months for the pain to subside. I took 40 Mg for 10 years. It brought my cholestrol down but I could not stand all of the muscle pain. ,CADEC

Getting out of bed is painful. The nurse practitioner did admit that these side effects can occur after 2 to 3 years. She suggested that I stop taking it for a few weeks. I stopped 2 months ago, and will not take it again. The tingling in the neck has stopped, but the leg and shoulder pain has not abated. I am 70 years old, weigh 167 lbs, exercise daily, don't smoke, and eat fruits and vegetables.

I am 45 and a half years old and was on 20 mg of Lipitor due to genetically high LDL for a period of seven months. At that point, I started having terrible, migratory joint pain all over my body that was very distinct and pronounced. I also had disabling fatigue and flu-like malaise. Some nights I would go to bed at 6 pm and not get up until 8 or 9 the next morning. I was quite ill. My doctor did tons of lab work to rule out things like rheumatoid arthriitis, lupus, Lyme disease and active parvovirus infection. These all came back NEGATIVE. Finally, I was taken off Lipitor to see if the drug had anything to do with my symptoms. Within 72 hours I noted an improvement; within seven days, the symptoms were completely gone and I was restored to health. I will not ever take Lipitor again as I believe it is liver-toxic and slowly poisons the patient. It did a great job of lowering my LDL (173 down to 60). My total cholesterol went from 238 down to 143. However, it nearly killed me in the process and I believe it is almost like a slow-acting poison. ",CADEC

Squeezed out a few drops and rubbed it in and pain relief was almost immediate. I read that this is prescribed for knee pain but my doctor gave me a sample because the voltaren has worked ok for me and I can't take Advil a lot because of the gastro effects. Boy,I love this stuff and will ask for a script next time I see the Rheumy. ",CADEC
LIPITOR.746,"After being on Lipitor for only two months, I was experiencing debilitating muscle pain in my arms, legs and back. Additionally, I was experiencing severe cramping in my legs and back. The good news was that my cholesterol dropped from 269 to 160. The bad news was that long term, it would likely impact the heart muscle. Once the doctor saw the CPK levels on my next liver function test, he called (himself) and said to stop taking Lipitor immediately. Interestingly, Niaspan had the same effect. I'm currently trying a therapy of 6000 mg. of vitamin C daily. An interesting site for information on this is www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/2003/11/09/ vitamin_c_beats_statins_in_cholesterol_heart_disease.htm and http://www.cqs.com/lipitor.htm.

Neurologist, cardiologist, and internist stated my symptoms were not all related to Lipitor side effects. After trying Zocor, Provachol, Zetia and Crestor, Lipitor seemed to be the lessor of the evils with regard to side effects. However, due to heart problems, cardiologist gradually increased the Lipitor dosage from 10mg to 40mg. Symptoms have been gradual over the years with recent face and scalp problems diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia after MRI ruled out tumor or MS. After reading your comments regarding Liptior, I have decided to reduce the dosage from 40mg to 20mg for a week to see if this relieves the most recent symptoms. If improvement is noted, then I will contact my doctor for a further reduction in the dosage to determine if other symptoms abate.

I went off the lipitor and within 3 days the pains were going away, 10 days and all was well. It is a great med as long as you don't have the side effects. My MD says that it is soluble in fat and builds up in the muscle. He switched me to Crestor, similar med, but water soluble so it doesn't build up in your body as much. So far so good. ",CADEC

LIPITOR.3,"I started taking Lipitor in December 2009 and stopped after 4 months. During this time I experienced extreme pain in both shoulders, sometimes in the neck also, causing me to wake several times each night. Pain was worse in the morning but rarely went away completely during the day. Most mornings it was impossible to wash my hair in the shower as I was unable to reach the top of my head with my hands. Pain and restricted movement often prevented me from putting on shoes and socks without assistance. In January this year I started experiencing discomfort in my left hand for the first time. Now in both hands, the pain has increased, fingers are swollen and movement is restricted. My wife tells me my hands are warm to touch. The mornings are worse when they hurt the most, movement is restricted and it is impossible to make a fist. Ice and ibruprofen gel help but only for a short while. I have been taking 400 mg Ibruprofen 3 times daily for a couple of weeks on my doctors advice without. This drug is clearly POISON to so many people and perhaps there is good reason to take Pfizer to the courts. However I do believe that any Doctor prescribing Lipitor should make it abundantly clear to the patient that very serious consequences could ensue that would cause extreme pain and could effect quality of life. I believe that failure to do so is a serious deriliction of duty that should be tested with complaints to the medical authorities that oversee our doctors and/or the courts. ",CADEC

Playing basketball has become impossible. Even a simple pass causes significant pain. The pain in my arms interrupts my sleep. I thought that I was just aging and/or out of shape, but it might be the lipitor. I am going off the medication and trying CoQ supplements and vitamin C to see if this helps. ",CADEC

ARTHROTEC.24,"I have taken 6 pills in the past (75mg each), but the side effect I had from my last pill was awful. It induced severe vaginal cramps without bleeding about 2 hours after I took the medication. I ended up having to take additional medication to get rid of the cramps (pamprin) so that I could sleep. Sat on the bathroom for 30 minutes. If I knew I would have went to bed with a sore knee instead - it hurt less than the cramps. This is the only anti-inflammatory drug that helps for my knee pain/inflammation and its reliable in that. I take it infrequently, once every several months and 1 pill is often enough for me. ",CADEC
ARTHROTEC.30,"I have been on Arthrotec for a year and a half and have been very pleased that it does help deal with my back pain. However. over the last six months, I have started having vaginal bleeding almost every day of the month. Lots of clotting, and horrible periods. I went to the obgyn and everything came out normal. The doc put me on birth control. But, the bleeding has not subsided. So now I am scheduled to have an endometrial biopsy on Wed. I had an ephiphany last night about Arthrotec and began researching the side effect. When I came across this website, I was appalled that the majority of the females mention heavy/extra vaginal bleeding. I firmly believe this is the answer to my bleeding problem and will be telling the doctor on Monday,. Although this drug has helped with the pain, it is not worth the cost and hassle of bleeding constantly., On top of that, I am now having to have a procedure that a 31 year old should not have to endure. I truly hope that there are no long term effects from this. I have not taken Arthrotec in almost a week, yet I am still bleeding. I do not look forward to the extra pains I will llkely experience in a couple weeks, but I am sure I can find something else to deal with them.

Stopped taking Lipitor and I haven't felt better. I noticed a difference within a week. These drugs are poison and should be taken off the market. I am now taking CoQ10 with Vitamin E to try and heal my body. From all the reading I have done, the doctor should have told me to take this because the statins deplete your body of CoQ10. ",CADEC

At the time I attributed it to male menopause-being around 54. I went to my accupuncturist and was told my chee was dry. Had 4 treatments over as many weeks. Started to see some improvement. At the onset of symptoms I felt like I would imagine someone that had MS would feel like, swaying, pulling myself up stairs, dragging legs. After having stopped lipitor and acupuncture treatments, I would say I am at about 50 or 55%. I hope I continue to keep getting better as this has really hit my life at a bad time. My cholesterol did go down but If I knew I would have these kinds of problems I would never have started taking the drug nor will I EVER AGAIN take it irregardless of my cholesterol level. I would recommend to those who have not had any lessening of symptons to try accupuncture. It can't hurt and may help!. ",CADEC

I also take some alternatives which have definately made a differance. I dropped my Lipitor of 20mg down to every other day instead of just laying off of it and this has been pretty much the case so far. Collestrol has stablized at 147-158 and really not on any diet.

However, I have noticed in the ""patient info"" they give with my Rx that now warnings of NSAID's causing heart attacks and strokes are written where they were not before when I started this Rx. The best dose for me (per my doctor) is 2 pills to get in your system, then 1 every 8 hours afterward. Luckily, I only need this a few days a week at the most, here & there.

I take 40mgs/day, may be able to lower it since my total cholesterol dropped from 300 to 120 in two months. My doctor put me on CoQ 10 at the same time as the Lipitor, and explained possible side effects. Lipitor actually reversed blockages in one of my brothers. 4 out of 5 of us are on statins - 3 Lipitor. No serious bad effects. Try CoQ 10 to prevent/reduce side effects. ",CADEC

I've started exercising/dieting more and lost 15 pounds in last month, but not around the middle much. Some darkness in urine, but I think it's due to not enough fluids. Nonetheless, I'm very happy with the drug. Went from 341 to 220 using 20mgs despite the fact I wasn't dieting as much as I should have been. Now on 40mg but am eating more healthy and will have blood checked soon. Am hoping to go back to 20mg, though I have not seen any difference symptom-wise between 20 and 40.

Also, hot/cold fever-like sensations in the skin, but no fever. Constant sleepiness. I thought I had developed chronic fatigue syndrome and restless leg syndrome until I looked on the internet for Lipitor side effects. I am just glad I stopped taking it before permanent damage was done. Yes, it did a great job lowering my cholesterol, but the side effects are very dangerous and I would think long and hard before taking any statin. I would guess that many of our elderly relatives who seem to have cognitive impairments are really suffering from statin side effects. The drug companies have certainly done a number on the American public. ",CADEC

When my doctor upped my dose to 40 mg, to treat aggressively a spike in my blood sugar, in three weeks I developed such severe stomach pain that I literally couldn't walk more than half a block without doubling over in agony.

LIPITOR.619,"Terrible pain in hips and shoulders. After taking Lipitor for a year, I started having pain in my hip. Told Dr about it, he didn't seem to concerned. After about 1 1/2 years I started having pain in my shoulders. The pain is so bad at this point that it wakes me up at night and extremely limits the use of my arms. Dr sent me for x-rays, MRI, to see an orthopedic surgeon. All results negative. They suggested it could be tendonitis or avascular necrosis and recommended anti-inflammatories. Nobody ever suggested it could be the drug until I found this site doing research on my pain. It makes me wonder how powerful these drug companies are that doctors won't even suggest that the drug could be the problem. I'm stopping this drug today in the hopes that the pain goes away. Hopefully I'll be able to play catch with my boys and swing a golf club again some day. If I die of a heart attack from high cholesteral in 20 years, so be it.

Remaining issue is chest spasm -- have been through tests ruling out heart, GERD, pneumonia, etc Spasms persist although less and less. Last 48 hours, epsiodes seemed to increase again but may be attributable to some combination of muscle weakness and heavy non-stop rains we've enjoyed for several days. Cholesterol news is great -- two days after I stopped, cholesterol was measured at 172 with excellent HDL, LDL and triglyceride levels -- down from 295 in May, consistent with the last ten years of cholesterol readings for me.

LIPITOR.546,"I had been taking Lipitor 10mg for 2 years. About 6 mons. ago, I decided to tell my Dr I was having muscle pain and leg cramps. He switched to Pravachol 20mg. I lasted about 2 weeks. The pain was worse. Then I decided to look on the internet to find out what was causing the pain. It was Statin. I looked that up and found what it does to the body. So, I decided to stop taking any drug and take some Q10 to build my body back up. Two months later went back on Lipitor with the Q10. 2 months later, the pain was back. Twice as bad as before, plus a whole bunch of other side effects, you see I'm seriuosly allergic to the Statin. And I know now, why I should have known this, but no one told me about it. When you are taking Statin and drink alcohol the side effects increase dramatically. When ever I drank, sipped a little wine, by body hurt so bad, I thought I had the flu. And no Aleve, or pain killer would help. I thought I was allergic to the alcohol. But now I know it was the Statin. Here are a list of the side-effects I had, that started slowly and in two years, became unbearable: Insomina,abnoraml dreams, depression, memory loss, photosensitivity, muscle pain, leg cramps, rhinitis, bronchitis, asthma, dry skin, tinnitus (left ear) taste loss, dry eyes, weight gain and finally hypertension. During the two years, I was on the Lipitor, all these syptoms started out slowly. First came the tinnitus. My Dr sent me to the ear Dr. Found no problem, I would have to live with it. Second, came depression, Dr put me on Zoloft. Then came the sinus problems, Dr put me on Rhinocort. During all this I felt like I was 80 years old. My neck hurt, my hips hurt. We got a $3,000.00 sleep by number bed to relieve the pain. Didn't really help. Insomia was constant. I got hooked on Tylenol PM. I gained a lot of weight. Went to Lindora to loss weight, so I could get off the Lipitor. Lost 40 lbs. Dr said to stay on Lipitor for prevention. This is when I decided to check it out on the internet. When I went back on the Lipitor, about 2 months ago, I had a small drink of wine at a wedding. That night my body aches were so bad, I could hardly stand it. Then two days later I came down with bronhitis, and asthma. I have asthma anyway, but it was the worse case I've had in 13 years. Then I had sinus problems again. My Dr took x-rays for pneumonia and sinus infection, Came back clear. My Dr wanted me to see an ear nose and throat Dr Then my blood pressure went up to 198/90. I have never in my life had high blood pressure. Dr put me on Norvasc. Then I had two horrible nightmares. I finally, went on the internet and looked at side effects for Lipitor. When I saw all the side-effects, I nearly died. I have all the syptoms. I stopped taking Lipitor that instant. That was one week ago. I'm starting feel a little better. I've gone to my Dr and asked him if he new about the alcohol related problem. He said, no. There is no warning on the prescription bottle, to tell you to watch out for a reaction with alcohol. The Dr is now doing tests, to see if there has been any damage to my heart and muscles. I also, asked for physical theraphy for my left shoulder and neck. My left shoulder is almost immobile. I think the tinnitus in my left ear has been caused by the Lipitor. I hope it goes away soon. I also, lost my sense of taste during this whole thing. I would recommend anyone who has experienced any side effects increased by alcohol, to consider an allergic reaction to the drug. Dr was thinking about putting on another Statin drug.

I will never take lipitor before bed again, I may cut the daily dose in half and possibly stop altogether if the pain persists at an intolerable level. Lipitor has lowered my cholesterol levels to the 180's. I had never had a reading below 218 in my life and it has been steadily rising over the last few years to a consistent level in the 240's. The ratio of bad to good cholesterol is in the acceptable zone and never had been before taking lipitor. So, all in all, the lipitor has done a good job.

Pfizer Inc.(maker of Lipitor) AMOUNT AT ISSUE: $$$ Pending, Cholesterol-Fighting Drug Tied to Liver, Kidney Injury, The Kahn Gauthier Law Group is investigating possible legal actions against Pfizer Inc., the manufacturer of the cholesterol-lowering drug Lipitor (atorvastatin), to recover for liver or kidney damage suffered by patients prescribed Lipitor. Like other drugs in its class (the statins), Lipitor can cause elevated liver enzymes. In clinical trials, this occurred in 0.7 percent of the patients, but the rate was much higher for those taking the 80 mg dose. Another serious side effect of Lipitor and other statins is a condition called rhabdomyolysis, in which muscle cells break down and release potentially toxic cell contents into the bloodstream., Symptoms of rhabdomyolysis include muscle pain, tenderness and weakness--most commonly in the calves and lower back. Malaise, fever, dark urine, vomiting and nausea can also be symptoms. The most feared consequence of rhabdomyolysis is acute kidney failure, occurring in 30-40% of the cases.

It did not help improve my memory nor do anything for my social anxiety though. The first 6 weeks there was a lot of running to the bathroom - I don't see how someone like a truck driver could ever take this drug. As time went on, my sexual sensitivity began to diminish, my weight began to skyrocket (20+ lbs.) and the benefits of the drug began to be outweighed by the anxiety and depression caused by getting fat and sexual dysfunction - so I quit and decided to take a cognitive approach (listening to self-help tapes with positive messaging) and exercise. It's been a few months without and I'm OK - but withdrawal is a *bitch*. To me it feels like you are feverish and it lasted maybe 5-6 weeks. Let's not be too dramatic here - I didn't feel like it was the end of the world, but it was no walk in the park. I did half my dose for 2 weeks before quitting, though.

Then, when I got worse, they put me back on it. That time, however, was the most horrendous experience of my life. I sat with my head over the toilet vomiting whilst slurring random words and throwing toiletries at the people who surounded me.

I went along hoping against hope that the panic attack I had one day would be the last one. I would go along a few days without one and then be so disappointed to have another one. I was having a lot of these while driving and I was beginning to avoid driving to prevent them. It was getting quite debilitating because my work requires driving to different places at times.     Now, for the 10 months I've been taking Lexapro, I've only had three instances where I could feel myself going into a panic attack - this is a huge decrease.

The remaining side effects - weight gain and sleepiness - I'm in the process right now of deciding whether or not I want to live with them. The alternative right now would be having the weekly panic attacks again which I am in no mood to continue.     I also notice not worrying so much anymore about things - I used to worry about everything. Problems  don't seem so overwhelming. I also have noticed that I don't get so upset and rattled by other people's rudeness or nasty comments anymore. I'm more likely to just shrug them off and go on my merry way.",PsyTar

Once the Med had firmly taken hold of me, my life turned from one full of anxiety, fear and depression, too one of absolute fulfillment and happiness.  Six months on 20mg, decreasing to 10mg for 12 months.  My final 3 months I was on 5mg, before whenning myself off completely.

lexapro.139,"nausea, loss of appetite, trouble sleeping I initially took Lexapro at 10mg with my Wellbutrin in order to stop a debilitating depressive episode from progressing. The side effects got better after 2 months. Then I got lazy and wasn't consistent about taking it and whenever I tried to take it again I'd deal with horrible nausea, so I weaned off. After about 4 months of being off, I noticed my irritability and anxiety increasing, so my new doc suggested a measly 2.5 mg dosage. I'm dealing with mild nausea but feel the calming affects. I need to hang in there. BUT I think we all need to remember why we turned to anti-depressants in the first place - because we were severely depressed or ridden with debilitating anxiety that affected us living a good quality of life. If life was better off the meds than perhaps you didn't need them as bad as others do. When my side effects are difficult to deal with, I remember that a debilitating major depressive episode, wanting to curl up and die, is FAR worse and I am thankful that I have options to help me live a normal life.",PsyTar

The side effects were severe, but diminished as time passed, and have become tolerable within 2-3 months.   For me it became a question of balance: Lexapro side effects vs. depression and its side effects.  After 1 1/2 years on Lexapro, I believe that it has a very short shelf life, less than 30 days, and is extremely sensitive to temperature/humidity fluctuations & extremes. Every month, when I'm down to my last 3-8 pills of my supply, I notice that I get depressed often and have sudden mood swings. This is consistent every month. When I start a 'new' 30 day batch of pills, I go through minor side effects for a few days.

At the time I started the drugs, I was in a major depression.  Wellbutrin helped immediately to let me think entire thoughts again (without interruptions in my thinking because I felt so sad.) Adding Lexapro improved my mood.   I started at 5 mg and worked slowly up to 20 mg.  After 2 years at 20 mg, my thoughts became bitchy and impatient again.  My psych recommended increasing the lexapro dosage to deal with it.  I chose the opposite path:  I tapered off both Lexapro and Wellbutrin and am focusing on nutrition and exercise to keep my mood steady and generally positive.  Psychiatrist disagrees with my approach and says Lexapro is a drug for life.  I am sleeping more deeply now, without the intense anxious dreams that I had on the drugs.

It's not like a sore stomach, but it feels like your abdomen is tensed up, which I initially mistook for a sign of additional anxiety.  However, according to my doctor this tension in the stomach area is purely a chemical reaction to the medicine and not connected with an emotional state.  His notion is validated by my increased ability to sleep, which is never possible if I'm anxious.  This stomach discomfort has faded about 75%, as my body acclimates to the drug.

They ran entire body scans and told me I was the healthiest person ever.   Visited the psychologist who prescribed me and he promised if I just stuck with it, it would pass. And he was right! Almost exactly after the second week I woke up one morning and I felt 100% better.  Xanax was the godsend to get me through the side effects. Take it as prescribed and it is your best friend. I've read nothing but negative reviews on this drug. Some people even claim that the first day of taking the pill it was either aweful or amazing. Just know that you WILL NOT feel any effect for 3-5 days as it takes time for it to build up in your body.   I started taking this for my Post Partum. I was to the point that if I even looked at my baby or heard his voice I wanted to vomit. I wanted nothing to do with him. I wanted him away from me as far as possible. I knew there was something wrong with that, so I spoke to a psychologist and he prescribed me lexapro. I started off on 2.5 mg for one week. Then 5 the next week (those 2 weeks were the worst) then  I worked up to 10mg. I felt so much better but I still had the feeling of uneasiness. So he bumped me up to 15. That was the magic number. I was totally back to normal.  It's been 1yr now and my little baby is now 1.5 yrs old. I feel like I don't need it any more. So my dr has me stepping off.

If I am sleepy at all the next day, it is because I was unable (due to my schedule) to get a full eight hours' sleep, not because of the Lexapro.  When I get eight hours, I have no sleepiness at all. I was on Wellbutrin prescribed by my PCP but she sent me to a psychiatrist because I was still very depressed.  The psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro because I was also having severe mood swings and rage along with the depression, completely stressed out and unhappy.  He started me on 10 mg per day, and I can honestly say that I feel better than I have ever felt in my life.  Crises are quickly put into perspective, I feel hopeful and happy and content, the kids' antics don't wig me out like they used to.  The fact that I am sleeping better, too, is a bonus, because I was having a terrible time sleeping more than three hours at a time and spent a couple of hours each night tossing and turning.

I stuck with it, and I am very glad I did. It has been 4.5 months and have had no adverse side effects from Zoloft. I am only on 25 mgs, but I feel it is working for me.  I have way more energy, actually crave social situations, when before I preferred solitude, I have a sex drive, and more confidence. The difference was very subtle, but remarkably and slowly life-changing. I am still me. I still feel, my emotions are not numb (thank God), but I no longer internalize, and foster negative feelings. In addition, I am more able to cope with life's blows without sinking into the abyss. As I've already noted, Zoloft is working very well for me. 4.5 months ago when I was researching Zoloft on-line, it seemed that the only people who wrote comments about Zoloft were those with horrible experiences, or had some other negative thing to say about it. Needless to say I was discouraged, very fearful and skeptical to try Zoloft for my first time. I felt I was relatively normal, with just mild depression and anxiety, I certainly did not want to make my situation WORSE! Well I am happy I stuck it out for the initial two weeks (you'll make it through too), because now I feel like myself, only fine-tuned. I promised myself that IF Zoloft worked for me, I would come back and write my experience here. Keep in mind...it is alot easier for anxious/depressed people, like most of us on this sight are/were to some degree, to report negative feedback.

The only complaint I have is that I found myself eating more than usual which caused some weight gain, but none that can't be managed without increasing exercise and eating healthier. I had some fatigue when first starting the prescription, but I no longer notice it.

cymbalta.26,"Short-term memory loss, shortened attention span, depression, suicidal thoughts, developed a stutter, always tired, nightmares, paranoia, extreme moods. When I first started Cymbalta, I didn't notice much of a difference. After a few months, I started to notice it was making me become somewhat bipolar - on it, I was annoyingly happy and jumpy, but after two hours of taking it, I felt the same, and after two more hours, I was extremely depressed. I had also noticed that it took more to hold my attention than it used to, and I couldn't remember things that happened or stuff people said five minutes before. A little after I began noticing this, I started stuttering, and my stutter got worse as I kept taking the medicine, as did all my other side effects. Sometimes when talking, I would stutter, and forget what I was saying. I decided I was going to stop taking it, so I did. Wow. My memory loss worsened, as did my stutter, attention span, and depression. One day, after a weekend of not having it, I couldn't get out of bed because I felt so bad. The whole day, I thought about dying. I began to have terrible nightmares which would keep me up",PsyTar

I have a very high tolerance for drugs, and I have been on meds almost consistently for thirteen years, trying almost everything possible.  Never have I had such side effects, nor have I ever felt as ""drugged"" as I did on Cymbalta: nervous and speeding.  The side effects were almost immediate.  Rarely do I ever think of suicide, but after two days the thought was almost constant.  I woke up after three hours sleep each of the four nights, and could not get back to sleep.  I was ""speeding"" the whole time, but felt no relief or, for that matter, a single positive effect.

cymbalta.47,"Cymbalta has the same adverse side effects of the other SSRI medications and then some. In fact, because of Cymbaltas adverse emotional reactions, the inherent inability to get an erection or orgasm that is more the norm in other SSRI medications appears to be even worse with this one. If that werent enough, it increases anxiety and thus has less value as an anti-depressant. Yet what was even more profound, I found that I was in a state of emotional upset at all times but wasnt aware of it until I stopped the medication 6 days ago. Bizarre sensations of profound guilt and regret about incidents from the past (childhood to adult), were constantly re-lived and extremely inflated to say the least. I found myself on the verge of tears at all times. To add to the constant emotional upset, I can now attribute Cymbalta to frustrating memory lapses and a dramatic compromise in my cognitive abilities which I had mistakenly blamed on my pain medication. This drug caused me t I have severe and chronic lower back pain with Fibromyalgia which resulted in my developing depression. Consequently, I was placed on anti-depressants to counteract the side effects of pain medication, and also because the constant pain sucked the life out of me. Initially I was on Effexor (YIKES!), but had to stop this drug after only a few days. Subsequently I was placed on Zoloft for several years, then Celexa for several more, and finally Cymbalta in an effort to decrease the SSRI side effects the first two medications had. Each time I switched drugs I had to stop completely to start the other. I had no adverse withdrawal side effects from either Zoloft or Celexa; however Cymbalta was a different story. I had tried several times before to quit Cymbalta but because of the extreme withdrawal side effects, I was forced to stay on it. The evidence for me is irrefutable; Cymbalta has absolutely no redeeming value when compared to any other type of SSRI anti-depressant. In Fact, I believe it should either be removed from the market or be deemed a controlled substance, not because patients would be inclined to abuse this drug, but that physicians are in an effort to improve mood and block pain without having to dispense pain medication. Even the most innocuous of prescribed pain medication has vastly more therapeutic value, simply because Cymbalta has none. DO NOT TAKE THIS DRUG, IT IS DANGEROUS.

I also have Chronic Fatigue Syndrome so my Dr. was hoping it would lift my depression and help me to regulate my sleep cycle and get up earlier in the morning.  Ever since I have been on it, I have not had one good night sleep.  I wake up about every two hours and am very restless throughout the night.  I have also had night sweats on a few occasions.  There were times where it made me feel even more anxious than I already was.  The one thing I did notice is it controlled my ruminating which was a bit of a relief.  However, I felt no better in regards to my depression.  Now I have to go through the hell of withdrawl for another two weeks.

They are extreme and debilitating. Gained weight rapidly while on this drug. Now, despite following a healthy, moderate diet and regularly exercising, my body will not lose weight.

I had so many of the frightening effects alot of you mentioned.  I immediately reversed the process, and, boy, do I feel more level, within 2 days.  I'm going back to Effexor XR, although my doctor told me today to continue the process with the Cymbalta! Ugh! He also increased the Xanax dosage slightly.

I have been on almost the whole array of psychiatric drugs and withdrawal from this one is the worst I have ever encountered.  I have a friend whose husband takes this drug for fibromyalgia and tried to get off it because they can't afford this medicine, but the withdrawal was so bad for him.  I guess they will have to keep the extra job to pay for the medicine.  I looked online to find at least 15 pages of withdrawal symptoms and over 30 pages to document the symptoms.

After one week on 30mg, my MD increased my dosage to 60mg.  This did not help me!  My condition deteriorated rapidly, at which point my doctor wanted to increase the dosage further.  I insisted that 30mg was working wonders, and he reluctantly prescribed a 2 week course at 30mg.  Well, that's where I've remained for 3 months now.  I'm very glad that I persisted with my opinion regarding the dosage.  The doctor still claims that 30mg is not even considered a therapeutic dose, but I know what works.

These drugs both had similar side effects to Cymbalta and hard to withdraw from with bad withdrawal symptoms the only difference is the Endep knocked me out at night and I slept well, only very drousy and tired during the day, sexual disfunction just the same.  So I figure in my mind that having one tablet to take and only pay for just one lot of medication ($34.20Aud) has to have a plus and only one set of side effects and withdrawal symptoms to cope with is even more a plus.      By the way, with Citropalapram had endless energy for the first year or so then just felt worn out and tired after that.

I have gone the fruit route - i will eat 4-5 apples/oranges/pears in one sitting, no diarrhea or constipation. Takes care of the sugar craving - i used to eat vegies lots and hardly any fruit, now it's reversed.  Also eat less meat - kind of grosses me out now - but i crave pecans, almonds etc...Increased mood SUBSTANTIALLY - although still very reactive around menstruation.

I can't even begin to describe how awful it is. Constipation was really bad in first month, now it comes and goes. I've increased my fiber through my diet -lots of fresh fruit and veggies, that seems to help.  Nausea is pretty much gone, and my sleep pattern seems to be normalizing now. For the first few weeks I was on it I had intense dreams, some of them unpleasant.  If I was able to finally get to sleep, the sleep was not good.  That has also subsided.

It at least did something, but the amount of side effects speaks for itself.    It helped anxiety slightly, but made my depression worse in my eyes. Despite the slight amount of energy I had, I felt even less motivation to direct it towards anything productive. My inability to think correctly lead me to get frustrated when I tried to get work done, and also lead me to being more rash with decision making.     Sleeping more did not affect my sleep schedule. In other words; I was up for less hours at a time. Weird dreams is honestly the only good thing about this drug for me. The amount of side effects sure made life even less fun than it already was.    Quitting this drug was horrible. Constantly felt like I was about to faint, felt like my brain was being zapped with an electrical discharge. These were strong feelings, even though I was gradually reducing the amount. I heard taking an SSRI while weaning off helped, since withdrawal from SSRIs is not nearly as bad, but I didn't have that since it was my decision to quit.    This is surprisingly strong stuff. My brain chemistry still feels different, and I wonder if I'll ever fully recover from this. This was my second in line for antidepressants, and if your doctor recommends this so soon, reject it.

I sleep better. I get fewer tension headaches. My energy levels are back to normal.

I did try 150mg a day for a week, but the benefits didn't increase. The main benefits for me are the reduction of anxiety and the improvement in my energy levels. I used to take Ativan for anxiety, but that made me absent-minded. Effexor doesn't make me so absent-minded. It hasn't really lifted my mood much, but my mood wasnt really my problem.

However, the side effects are awful, but to me it's worth it because after trying Lexapro, Wellbutrin, and Zoloft, this is the only thing that makes me feel better. I have to take Adderall XR in combination with the Effexor just to keep me awake during the day because if i don't, i absolutely can't function; I will literally just sleep all the time, to the point where it truly can disrupt my life at times. I had never experienced a fatigue like that before, and it can be very dibilitating. I have absolutely NO sex drive, but that didn't happen until about a year ago. I wake up a lot in the morning with my jaw feeling tired and aching, and it never even occured to me that it may have been because of the Effexor (until i came upon this site!).

I was much easier to get along with, didn't blow things out of proportion and had a much more positive attitude about life.

effexorXR.228,"The only side effects I experienced were mild insomnia and extreme shakiness for the first 3 days. I was never one to take any kind of drugs.  I would only take aspirin as a last resort. But I have to say that taking the Effexor has made me feel so much better.  I read all the side effects and was reluctant to start it, but knew that I needed to take something in order to function in life.  I am currently on 75 mgs per day and it has made a huge difference.  My advice to anyone considering taking the drug is don't stress out when reading the side effects.  All drugs effect people differently.  Give it a chance.  It took about 14 days for the drug to kick in.   The side effects did go away after about 4 days and when I increased my dose from 37.5 mgs to 75 mgs I didn't have any side  effects.  My Dr. prescribed xanax for me to take along with the   effexor for the first week which actually eliminated the shakiness and nervousness immediately.  I only had to take the xanax for the first three days on the Effexor.  I suggest that  if you decide to take the Effexor, having the xanax on hand for the first few days will help.  I have not had to increase my dosage as of yet.  I'm hoping to be able to stay on the 75 mgs for as long as possible.  Reading about the withdrawals is a little scarey, but like I said, all people are affected differently by different drugs, so I will cross that bridge if and when I get to it.  Effexor has made a huge difference in my life and when and if I have to come off it, if I experience any withdrawals, well, so be it.

Hands and fingers hurt so bad my husband has to help with bathroom responsibilities(wiping). I am 48 years old and had chemotherapy and had bone and joint pain with that. Nothing compares with what I am feeling now. Have done quite a lot of research-this pain doesn't go away for a lot of women after taking Arimidex even for a short while! Honestly I went this week and applied for disability at Social Security Commission I am so bad off. I am completely unable to work and see no improvement. My oncologist said he could easily see me being unable to work for a year or more-which is what is required by SS disability. I cannot afford to miss a year of work so",Annotated_dataset
